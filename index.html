    <h2>Basic Parts of a Guitar</h2>
      <p>Electric Guitars have many basic parts that one should be familiar with. Here is an image and the names listed</p>

      <h3>Headstock</h3>
        <p>The headstock is the uppermost part of the guitar. Generally it holds the tuning pegs, truss rod nut, and the brand name. Different Brands also have different headstock shapes. There are other parts that you might find like the string retainer/string trees</p>
      <h3>Nut</h3>
        <p>This is located where the neck meets the headstock. It serves many key functions. It holds the strings in place as they run from the bridge to the tuning pegs and is responsible for their proper spacing. Different nut heights also affect the action of the guitar or the strings height from the fretboard. Nuts can be made from various materials, including plastic, bone, or synthetic materials, each affecting tone and sustain. There are also locking nuts that maintain the strings stability after tuning by clamping down on them.</p>
      <h3>Tuning Pegs</h3>
        <p>The tuning pegs hold the strings as they are winded around them. Turning these raises or lowers the pitch and thus this part is used for tuning the guitr</p>
      <h3>Frets</h3>
        <p>Frets are the metal strips that run perpendicular to the neck. Pressing the string behind the frets shortens it and changes the pitch. The frets are arranges chromatically, with each fret playing a note a semitone higher than the next.</p>
      <h3>Truss Rod</h3>
        <p>The truss rod runs inside the neck and helps counteract the tension imposed by the strings and affects the relief of the neck (how it bends slightly). The truss rod typically has a truss rod nut that can be adjusted to change the relief of the neck in order to make it more comfortable to play.</p>
      <h3>Fret Markers</h3>
        <p>The fret markers indicate which fret you are at within the neck. They are generally placed at frets 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12. You can also find them 12 frets above those frets (excluding 13) at 15, 17, 19. 21, amd 24</p>
      <h3>Neck</h3>
        <p>The neck is what holds the frets and fret markers along with the fretboard. The neck can come in different shapes that change the feel of it and overall comfort. There is also different fretboard radius' that is how much the fingerboard arches.</p>
      <h3>Neck Joint</h3>
        <p>This is where the neck meets the body on the guitar. This joint can be a bolt-on, set neck, or through-body, depending on the guitar's design.</p>
      <h3>Body</h3>
        <p>The body is the largest part of the guitar and serves as the a platform for the bridge and electronic components. It amplifies the sound produced by the strings and affects the guitar's tone and volume. The body can come in various shapes.</p>
      <h3>Pickups</h3>
        <p>The pickups are responsible for pickup the strings vibrations and converting it into an electrical signal that can be amplified. There are many different pickups with unique tones like single-coils and humbuckers along with active and passive pickups</p>
      <h3>Knobs</h3>
        <p>There are two types of knobs you will generally find on a guitar. These are the volume and tone knobs. The volume knob adjusts the overall volume of the guiar (and even the tone in some cases) while the tone knob changes the tone fo your guitar generally by reducing higher frequencies.</p>
      <h3>Bridge</h3>
        <p>The bridge is on the opposite side of the nut and serves a similar purpose. It anchors the strings, affecting their spacing and height. The bridge can be adjusted to fix intonation and floating bridges can pivot back and forth to raise or lower pitch of the strings</p>
      <h3>Pick gaurd</h3>
        <p>This may or may not be present on some models. It generally protects the guitars finish from scratches due to strumming/picking.</p>

    <h2>Notes on the Guitar</h2>
      <h3>Open Strings</h3>
        <p>The open strings on a guitar play different notes with thicker strings playing the lower notes while thinner strings play the higher notes. The standard turning for these strings from lowest to highest is E,A,D,G,B,E.</p>
      <h3>Notes through the Fretboard</h3>
        <p>As you move down each fret the corresponding note is a semitone greater than the last. The notes in order a C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A, A#/Bb, B, and back to C where it loops (albeit an octave higher). Because it works like a loop you can start on any note and follow the pattern. The string loops and octave higher at the 12th fret which divides the neck in half.</p>
        <h4>Intervals</h4>
          <p>Beyond just moving sequentially (moving in semitones) from one note to the next you can take skip semitones over to move to another note. These movements of greater semitones are called intervals each have unique names.</p>

      <h3>Harmonics on Guitar</h3>
        <p>Along with the basic notes on a fretboard there are harmonics on the guitar that can be found. These can be found by pressing down on a node where the string is vibrating. These nodes divide the string into even parts and multiply the pitch by the number of parts you divide it by. <br> Common harmonics include the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th harmonics which are found respectively at frets 12, 7, 5, 9. These are just the common positions however. Since they divide the guitar evenly each harmonic can be found in other places too that divide the guitar all the same. Here is a source to visualize this better:</p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Harmonic_series_on_a_string.gif" alt="Visualization of Harmonics">
        <p>Harmonics are essentially infinite however the more we divide the string the string the lower the volume of the harmonic. The most common harmonics on the guitar are 1-12.</p>
      <h3>Harmonics Corresponding Notes</h3>
            <p>Since each harmonic has a different pitch that is based on multiplying the fundamental they can be assigned notes. If you divide these notes by 2 continously (lowering it an octave each time) then you will eventually reach an interval from the fundamental. Here are the following intervals from the 1st all the way to the 12th harmonic:</p>

        <td>Perfect Fifth</td>

    <h4>Positions for the Harmonic</h4>
      <p>The positions for each harmonic are calculated by dividing the string into the number of parts the corresponds to the harmonic. For example the fifth harmonic can be found by dividing the string into five equal parts and lightly touching it at any of the parts. A visualization of where you can find each harmonic on a 25.5' scale guitar can be viewed here:</p>

            <h6>Small Disclaimer</h6>
              <p>If you have a good ear you might notice the harmonics don't sound exactly like the interval I assigned. This is because harmonics follow just intonation which is based on multiplying the fundamental by an integer and dividing by 2 to return within an octave. The intervals we use however are based 12-tone equal temperament which is based on taking the octave and dividing it into 12 equal sections. Although just intonation and 12tet have some intervals that come close to each other, like very close fifths and major thirds, not all of them do. For example the 7th harmonic is closest to the minor seventh however it falls 30 cents flat. It can be called the harmonic seventh although the harmonic seventh is not present in 12tet. Similarly although the 11th harmonic is closest to the augmented fourth it falls 49 cents flat. This means its closer to being halfway between the perfect fourth and the augmented fourth.</p>
